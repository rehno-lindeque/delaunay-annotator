# Segmentation Editor for Image Annotation (Work-in-progress)

This project is going to be a segmentation editor for image annotation. It will use Delaunay triangulations to make annotating quick and to avoid building a lot of drawing tools.

# Usage

This is not usable yet, currently it's just for internal experimentation at CircuitHub.
